# Feature Specification: Init Environment Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-init`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "init"

## Execution Flow (main)
1. Confirm repository prerequisites are met (Python ≥ 3.11, Docker Engine with Compose, `make` available).
2. Ensure `.env` is prepared from `.env.example` with required secrets.
3. Run the single command `make init` (or equivalent entry point) to initialize the workspace.
4. Command prepares isolated environment, installs middleware runtime dependencies, installs quality tooling, and caches environment marker.
5. Command outputs human-readable summary with next steps (e.g., `make up`, `make lint`, `make test`) and surfaces any warnings.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a middleware developer onboarding to the project, I need one deterministic command that provisions my local environment so I can run services and quality checks without manual dependency setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a clean workstation with prerequisites installed, **When** the developer runs the init command, **Then** a ready-to-use isolated environment with middleware runtime and quality tooling is available and the command exits successfully.
2. **Given** a previously initialized environment that may be outdated, **When** the developer re-runs the init command, **Then** the environment refreshes dependencies without manual cleanup and confirms success.

### Edge Cases
- System detects missing or outdated prerequisites (e.g., Python version, Docker) and stops with actionable guidance.
- `.env` is missing or lacks required keys and the command escalates before modifying anything [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should init abort, prompt to copy `.env.example`, or allow execution with warnings?].
- Insufficient disk space or permission issues prevent creation of the isolated environment and the command reports the unmet requirement without partial installation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provide a single documented init command that teams use for every local setup to avoid drift.
- **FR-002**: Validate core prerequisites (Python ≥ 3.11, Docker Engine with Compose, availability of `make`) before performing changes and surface remediation steps on failure.
- **FR-003**: Create or refresh an isolated environment dedicated to MasterMobile so that subsequent commands (`make up`, quality checks) run against consistent dependencies.
- **FR-004**: Install the middleware runtime dependencies together with standard quality tooling (linting, typing, testing) defined in the handbook so they are immediately available after completion.
- **FR-005**: Guarantee idempotent behavior; rerunning the command must not corrupt the environment and should update dependencies when versions change.
- **FR-006**: Emit a completion summary that states the environment location, the versions of key toolchains, and recommended next commands for progressing through the automated algorithm.
- **FR-007**: Detect mismatches between `.env` and `.env.example` to avoid running the stack with stale configuration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: do we block execution or provide a warning log with specific missing keys?].
- **FR-008**: Provide exit codes and logs suitable for automated agents so pipeline scripts can assert success without parsing interactive prompts.

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- `.env` continues to be managed manually from `.env.example`; init must not overwrite user-provided secrets.
- Developers already possess credentials needed for private package indexes or proxies; init can surface missing secrets but cannot bootstrap them automatically.
- Corporate environments may require outbound proxy configuration for package installation; the command should respect existing proxy-related environment variables.
