# STT Smoke Test Clips

- Synthetic speech is generated on demand by `generate_clips.py`, which wraps the open-source [`gTTS`](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS) client for Google Text-to-Speech.
- Spoken phrases are authored specifically for this repository's smoke tests; they contain no personal data.
- Audio artifacts are not stored in the repository. Review Google's Terms of Service before running the generator or redistributing the resulting files outside this project.
